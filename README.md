   - everyone connect at that link.
   - users that are selected by you through their checkboxes (sorted by users).
   - users that have selected videos that you selected (sorted by videos).

# Info for developers

All the frontend code is available on GitHub.

The backend login/users platform can be developed in any language.

The connections are implemented using Firebase but other technologies can be used.

Our initial ain was to submit to Meta Horizon Start Developer Competition.

All frontend code was developed from scratch except JS methods for cloud communication. 

# Next developments

Improve on placing artificial planes manually by hand tracking or other means.

Using anchors when plane detection is not available in WebXR (phones, tablets).
